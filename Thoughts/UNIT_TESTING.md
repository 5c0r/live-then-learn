## Why 


## When


## What


## How 


## Overall
- I wrote tests, but they are somehow flawed in many uncertain ways
- Unit testing does not work well for me, most of the time. I did prefer to call it functional testing, as *functional adult*  (My first test method is always named ShouldWorkOOTB, lol )
- Integration tests need too many *buildup/teardown* , but after that, profit.
- Not really a TDD enthusiast , since 70% of the work I have done are tested...after they are implemented
- Sometime we tested the same implementation too many times, I would say a repetition of one single implementation, just with different test name
- Don't follow 'best practices' for testing, please.
