## The Testing Pyramid and Testing Pharaoh

## When you should test 


## When/what you should not test 


## Personal take

- It is always a matter of choice between choosing to test your code reactively or proactively
- Don't test stuff that is already tested ( i.e: most library already had integration testing on their end..)
- Tests can either be ugly , but they works most of the time :)
