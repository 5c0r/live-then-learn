## Background
Recently why I was "invited" (as a newcomer) to hear about how one career progression could be. One fellow ( unfortunately with the same last name) tried to ask something about "how to level up, if you don't do back-end work"

I was quite like "what" for a few second , and just threw out some "trash talk" : If everyone is level 4 , then nobody is level 4. While levelling framework is important, most of us will never reach there

This seems to be a legitimate concern, but it is likely to be a very "toxic" behaviour , and this will likely affect not only the person itself, but also their peers. Let's hope that I am not 'infected' , up to this moment , lul.

## The whys ?

### You are likely to focus on "the game"
- You like to socialize , to getting to know about "the pay"
- You like to make your colleagues like you "as a person" ( Jes SOK-Group, that's how you like me)
- Peer reviews , pick your most trusted person that will likely to "lift you up" , and will never "let you down" ..hu hu

### You think you are doing 'menial' work  || front-end work
- FYIdiot, FE developers and Mobile developers are currently getting paid much more than back-end, while the overhead is lower ( or just a little bit lower). Because the Web technology has been growing quite quick. 

While back-end technologies has been revolving around databases ( or new way to store data ) , or DevOps Tools/process is getting better and better. 

-> While there are too many front-end developers out there, this does not meant that "everyone" is doing a good job, or as good as you do

### You think people setting doing nothing and getting paid more than you
- And yet, you are still an idiot..


## Wait wait Tree. You said me being caring about my "career progression" is being "toxic to me and peers around". But in which context ?
- Career progression was not communicated well in the company, where you are not sure how could you be "better" in your career
- How you treating your team is more important than how you are doing "teamwork" ( i.e: The 'fashion' company could be related ? )
- You are actually very (x3) bad on what you are doing, and you feel way to insecure in your freaking career. Perhaps you are right
- Your manager are doing the same thing, and you have to 'follow' it
- Salary is a taboo , and the IT-salary is way fucking bloated


## How to keep being an IC level "too-low" ?
- Doing "meaningful" work, work that involves "bettering your OKRs" , while not delivering any business values
- Too focused on OKRs for reward, rather than "how I could make this OKR work"
- Spend too much time writing on "why you should `promote` me ? " instead of "doing the right work rightly"
- Doing the work without understanding the context and how it should be done ?
- Stop having legitimate question while ignoring things
- Being an "Socializer" without good understanding on the product, or the team, or what they are doing

## But what if most people , everyone / every Vietnamese are doing this ?

- You should feel lucky that you are not "part of them"
- If this spread to others fellows, perhaps  you should leave them /the team / the company anyway
- Or you could stay, and be part of "the game" and enjoy your lives as you know it , because we were all paid for the soul, anyway (:


## Why "Nguoi Viet minh" being the way they do ?
- If you are following LinkedIn , and some Ufaktory drama , then you likely see that some Vietnamese are well unpaid, and even that they knew it, they let it slide anyway ( because of something called an A -resident permit) , just like H1B in Amurica , eh ? Putting salt into injuries , this is likely a case where "Nguoi Viet" treats "Nguoi Viet" rather than Finns treat "immigrants" ( maybe another refurbish phone company could related , or not anymore?)


DISCLAIMER:
- I am surely being responsible for what "I said" here. And why this was mostly targeted Vietnamese instead, because the "dataset" was all that , it's Sad but it's true.
- Sadly, these kind of behavior will be something like an "union" , where it was formed to do good for members, but now , it is just for the good of themselves. 

When will "Nguoi Viet minh"  ever ever grow up ?? You ask me
