Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

## Usual reasons that could make me fail interviews in Finland

- Anxiety ( could it be from excessive coffee/tee consumption ? Or are they just genetics ?)
- Experience in X,Y,Z ( 99% are platforms and Cloud services ?! )
- Work Experience ( Usually being a "student" might be a better reasoning in 2017? )
- Not being able to display the viable/rare skills ( What are these anyway ?)
- Not the whiteboard you want, but the whiteboard they need
- Finnish-language proficiency , usually apply to where most customers base are Finnish ( where's the 6% magic numbers come from ?)
- TODO:

## List of companies that I got rejected

### Finnair ( 2017 )
- Not experienced enough with Java ecosystem and etc, perhaps a front-end position at that time would be more suitable , but but ???

### Reaktor
- I was rejected once in 2015 as Summer Trainee position. Then the second time in 2017 for sparring session , ended up reading [this](https://github.com/reaktor/tips-for-ppl-who-want-to-learn) instead since then
Finally at April 2020, I got to interviews with one of the senior developers there, the discussion were long but fun and interesting. Unfortunately I am rejected due to being not very experienced with many things.
=> Maybe this is the time to stop :D  . Third-time the un-charm . Hey , perhaps a follow up writing would be....good

### Roima ( 2018 )
- The interview held quite long, I eventually got an answer back, but rejected due to recent merges. The situation is different after then :D. But all the interviewers are very nice and open about the discussion.
- Many rounds of interviews

### Circles Consulting / Siili / Houston Oyj
- Perhaps being 'too young' can be also a dis-advantage. [Perhaps I don't come back until I am 40/ doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVODv8A5-EM)

### Elisa
- Job description: writing some Java into their Set-top-box ?!?!
- Never gets an answer back. Due to not being proficient in Java (or perhaps understanding how static constructor works ?)

### Sniffie
- A small startup in Valimo, working on browser extension for price analysis/research
- Second round is to be more *technical* , we learned how to build Uber-lite
- First round went good / Second round looks better , but finally rejected as they have another candidate in mind.

Could never blame them, I was not quite good enough.
How about the other candidates ? He went to Digia anyway (@July 2020?) =))) ?

### Food delivery 'industries'
- Foodora: Ghosted
- Wolt: Not good enough at React and its ecosystem, or they accidentally hired 10 or few drame queens from a "Fashion company". Hopefully the time is different,
- But will I be joining them in the future so I could work with drama queens/kings ? Nope in 10^6 years ?

### Zalando ( 2018 )
- Recommended by a friend, passed the first "sanity" interview.
- I choked while writing a switch statement => Not experienced enough.
- HR was very polite and nice to inform that I did not passed the interview , so +1 for Zalando !

But who would like to join Zalando since 2017 anyway ? Stories will remain....stories

### Futurice/Columbia Road
- When you are not 'experienced' enough , and it is good time to give bootcamp students a chance to work :)
- And somehow my ex-boss mentioned about Futurice after I/another colleague failed there , coincidence ?

### Rightware Oyj ( 2018 )
- Passed first round interview
- Coding assignment: Write a Color mixer using WPF -> Big Success , made use of ReactiveUI
- Next interview round is more technical , many question about OOP and Algorithm -> Unfortunately the work at that time we don't really use these intensively. I realized that I do have trouble explaning things to them
=> Failed miserably, off course :D

### Ghosted ( :ghost: deserve having its own place ! )
- Unity : Had the first interviews, never heard back
- Futurice ( ghosted once, rejected twice :(  ) => Somehow
- Vincit
- Nitor

## I turned down the offer, stopped interviewing

### Solinor
- First and third interview went well
- Second interview is interesting , but yep , you are just 'Junior'
- We never went to an agreement in terms of salary. Solinor later acquired by Gofore ?! Perhaps the salary range is better now ??


### Supermetrics
- My PHP skill was...baaad ? ( Shame on me, I implemented them as Unit Tests :( )
- Now they are suggesting Javascript Developer position , and ...maybe not this time. If you are from Supermetrics and reading this, I would say while I can 70% pass the coding tests, I don't feel personally happy working with JavaScript , at least until JS-people know how to behave :)
