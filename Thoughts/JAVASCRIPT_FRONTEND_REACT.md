"Get a job fast-track. Learn React" - Internet

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is a library to build user interface, with simplicity and reactivity in mind

#### Useful stuff while learning/developing with React

##### Create-React-app
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

A very good scaffolding tool for your project. Unless you are a hardcore webpack-scaffolder ( which you are not )

##### Ajax alternatives
- isomorphic-fetch (https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch)
- axios (https://github.com/axios/axios)

##### State management lib

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
- [Recoil, A new challenger ! ](https://recoiljs.org/)

##### Later fundamentals to learn
- Hooks, Context API
- React Suspense (https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html)

#### Pros and Cons

##### Pros
- A better selling point than any other framework on the market
- Good documentation and tutorials
- Breaking changes are introduced with backward compatibility
- Many different version of React , to prove there is a better way ( Preact,..) . This does not mean the core feature was not kept

##### Cons
- You will need to learn state management, asynchronous operation, many others thing. Pick-your-poison experience..
- "I know how to React" is not the sexiest answer `to any employer`. The 'standard' for React-capable developers are quite unknown, and I am not sure there is the 'best-approach' for this
- "More is always less" in terms of choosing the good library that would suit you, your teams and your projects. In fact, there was never a right answer, until *someone* came in and say something, makes you afraid that you made `the wrong choice`
