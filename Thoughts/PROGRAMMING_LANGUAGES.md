### It's 2020, does "programming languages" matter ? 

There are many hot programming languages right now, and sure that if you want to land a job , fast lane, JS-HTML-CSS is a good fast-food combo for you.

Unfortunately my "bad jokes" are still relevant since 2014 that everyone will likely to learn JavaScript and land a job quickly, but being proficient in the language itself is something not very well appreciated ( Who learned C without learning *malloc()* and *free()* ? )

### Algorithms , leetcode and hackerrank , and also CODILITY is a 'must' ( in 2020 ) !
- Software interview are usually "borken". And I prefer having it more "humane" 
- These code testing platforms is now used to filter candidates, it has been proven to be effective in the early days, where people did not shared their code onlines..
- We do used algorithms in our everyday jobs, sometimes they are implemented in deeper layers :) - https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-i-actually-used-day-to-day/


### Being proficient in PLs / being proficient in programming
Are you a person who can learn basic syntax of a programming languages withtin a few days ? 
Do you enjoy its syntax and its flavor  ( features, syntatic sugar..) ? 
Do you think you can be proficient with the language ?
Will you able to build stuff with the language ? 
Is the ecosystem built around it something you are looking for ?



### What if something is not your "cup-of-tea"




### What PLs/programming paradigm(s) could you start with ?
