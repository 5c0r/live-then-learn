### Event Sourcing


#### What should you need to know
##### Domain Driven Design
Domain-Driven Design is a good start You would need to have a good understand on Domain Knowledge

##### CQRS
Somehow this is a pattern that I quite like working with. Your read and write concerns are separated, this might be difficult to handled on the UI side, but I think a few HTTP requests for a workflow would not hurt

##### Fundamental of Event Sourcing

#### What ES could help you
- Building the next microservices ?


#### ES could not help you if
- You have a limited understanding of customer's domain and domain knowledge


#### Implementing ES in any project. Do you need to have your application to be 100% Event-Sourced ?



#### My experience (so far)
TODO-TODO
- DDD + CQRS + ES is a good combo

- Why Kafka-esque thing ?
