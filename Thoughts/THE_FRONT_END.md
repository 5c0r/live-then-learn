This is a post to sum up my "experience" of making stuff happens on the UI


## Non-Web
- .NET : WPF with some experience using ReactiveUI. I personally would prefer build UI that works...reactively :)


## Web ( Order by complexity ? legacy-ti? )

======================
Ya ain't gonna need a Framework
======================
- JQuery:
- Using vanilla JavaScript/HTML
- Simple CSS library ?

======================
Ya nid frameworks!
Why:
-
======================
- AngularJS: Hmm nope

- Svelte: I am willing to put Svelte on the first, because of its simplicity
- React : The sexy candidate ,

- Angular ( the new , but not so sexy one):
- Vue


- Less/Sass


## Personal takes

#### If frameworks make your stuff gets built faster, Just do it (Sorry Shia Laboeuf)

#### Size and UI/UX matters
Considering the Web is for everyone. It  would not hurt to also learn Web Accessiblity and the performance of your Web Application

#### JavaScript fatigue is real
What ?
Why ?
How to deal with this ?
