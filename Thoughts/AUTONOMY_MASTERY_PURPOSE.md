## But , but but but...

I don't think Eric Bowman (ex-Engineering VP Zalando were behind this idea). But comes from Dan Pink https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_the_puzzle_of_motivation. Eric did embrace this terminology into Zalando, but unfortunately does not really back this idea thoroughly IMHO. 

Surely that this is somehow applied in Zalando at some extent, as they are trying to innovate their way around technology. But for embracing this in different organization requires different effort and stories, or maybe impossible to embrace as well.

But in terms of human innovation, this is important. Anyone would require all those 3 pillars to be proficient/efficient in specific domain. 

I personally would like to learn more about things, but I usually stuck at not having "Good enough" Purpose. The only "purpose" that I found to make sense is to learn on how I can build my own "SaaS"
