## NodeJS


### Is it a good time to learn/developing NodeJS now ?

It is always a good time to learn something that would prospect you for a long run. IMH experience, I heard that people are still teaching the ancient NodeJS

- Nada , I don't think so. It just means that we will just write JavaScript/TypeScript in a different runtime, hopefully a more secured runtime as advertised :)



#### Getting started with NodeJS
- Awesome NodeJS (https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
- MEAN, MERN , maybe replacing the M -> P ( PostgreSQL !!)
- The R (React) can be anything else ( pick your poison :) )
