## Winning interviews || The dark-side of interviewing process

I personally felt very uncomfortable while writing this, but I think this is good that this will be just left here, instead of stuck in my brain for a long while

Unfortunately, you will not be able to learn anything from me regarding this "Domain". Because I am "BAAAD" at these which I failed 97% of the time. But worry not, these are the stories that will likely light you up when you are down, or you will have some thoughts about how broken an interviews can be.

HUOM! a.k.a WARNING! : As these are not from my personal experience/practices, these are the stories that I have been told from friends, or "a-friend-of-many-other-friends". How these practices are exercised

IMHO, these are considered inethical and likely won't make me feel good at day, sleep well at night. If you are doing these, I wish you luck, and all the best maintaining your career :)

### Lying on your CVs
- Looks like a very easy-peasy task to add a specific Technology in the "Talent Tree" , even that if you only install them on your computers.
i.e: Any programming languages, databases or software, or cloud platforms...that you just touched/used, but not really worked with
- Or simply add what others had been doing for the past few years in the project, without really understanding what is the true meaning behind that.

Reasonings:
- Buzzwords are usually scanned instead ( TIL that some companies use machine for buzzwords scanning )
- Un-realistic work description ( 12 years of Kubernetes (This is 2020 at the time) or 4 years of FastAPI , wtf ?! )
=> Unless you worked overtime, this is likely to be.. very accurate
- Some missing criteria will make you look useless in employers' POV (i.e: @ACloudCompany: I am sorry, you need X years of NodeJS experiences ja Y years of AWS..)


### Cheating on your assignments
Many different approaches:
- Getting people to work on your assignment intentionally
- Finding the "solution" on the Internet ( insert any code repo here..)
- LeetCode, Hackerrank, Codility, => This is now like to become a "rat race" where copy-pasta is getting more easy..


### Getting to know interviews question and the 'right' answer before-hand
- The more sophisicated a system is , the more vulnerabilities that system has. Systemic interviews has systemic patterns and questions, and if you were able to know from "previous success candidates experiences", you will likely get 80% of chance to getting into interviews
- This can be done usually from a few calls from your "LinkedIn/social connections" , or social cult

### Conclusion and some personal take:

- The reasonings behind these approaches is that interviews are usually quite broken. And it has been proved to be broken since 1950s/ First industrial evolution ? I think this is just a getaway/payback from interviewees where some companies with broken processes, but then they striked this upon good ones..then we have a catch-22 !
- Sugarcoating stuffs is usually what we have been told to make our CVs brighter than other peers . And 99% of developers does not learn marketing!
- You decide to have machines scanning the CV for you. Now you have another problems (pro-tip: write a lot of buzzwords and display:hidden/ white-color fonts)
- Reference check is a viable method to make sure that the person know what is really written in the CV
- Asking the right questions usually gives employers many right answers..This takes time
- Don't look at certificates and years of experience, it is usually trivial to be faked
- Whiteboard testing can be controversial.
=> But it is a good method to test candidates as long as you don't test how anxiety they are ! Most of the developers could get anxiety while doing these , the important things are the insights we get after that ( job done ? do you Feel Good Inc. ?)
- 95% of engineers won't make it into FAAAAAANG, or would like to be in one anyway, why bother ?
- Would you rather spend 1 day / 4-6 hours to work on real things with your candidates (optionally invite them/ lunch/beer/ after ?), and chance of having a good coworker for the next few years ?
- Body languages could tell a lot, don't miss out on a F2F interviews
- GitHub is the developers' Instagram , of course...
- LinkedIn/looks can be deceiving.. Unfortunately what has been called the 4.0 evolution makes things worse :(
- Accepting of being rejected is always part of maturity , and what you could have learned from it. Never give up :)
- To be or not to be yourself, that is the answer. Don't spend your whole life fake it til you make it. If you are doing those, perhaps programming was never meant for you
- Looking for 'right' place and 'right' person is difficult, don't make it harder both ways
=> I'd prefer to have a more personal touch with my future candidates, and also my future colleagues as well

But who I am to judge the suitable time ?
