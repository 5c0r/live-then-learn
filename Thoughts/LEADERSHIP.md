16th December 2021. I decided to restart this topic , as I have been recently rejected as a "Engineering Manager" ( I would prefer Engineering Team Lead, but that's not important). There are quite much thing that I was able to learn and understand, I am still in a middle of processing everything that was given from the Hiring Manager still. Let's hope one day I would understand all of them


## What does it mean to be "Engineering Team Lead"
- You are not going to write code as much as you do as an IC ( where >70% you are not going to write any code )
- You are going to work with people
- You are going to make the team work (together, efficiently)
- You might need to be as good as the previous manager / or even better , in terms of making deliveries and peers happy
- You will be held accountable for your team delivery and mission
- You need to understand priorities , business mission, and making compromises
- You are the one who deliver news (both good and bad)


## What one needs to know

## Not everyone was born as a 'leader' . True or False ?


## My beliefs in Leadership
- Everything starts at Heart, then the Mind
- Push and Pull
- Trust, then must verify
- Clear expectation
- Clarification x 3
