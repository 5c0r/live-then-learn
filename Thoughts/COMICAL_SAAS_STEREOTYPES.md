## Comical SASS stereotypes
Hopefully I can "integrate" these into a more meaningful comics :) 

#### The Kompany
TODO

#### The Ivory Stack
TODO

#### The "implicit/internal" Lead aka The Lead
A mediocre developer who always dreamt of leading a team to 'success'. When the team only has 1 person, it is always expected that he could lead himself , but things did not end well for anyone. Any company had a hard time taking care of his drama..

#### That Front-end Guy
- Having a decent upto limited knowledge about programming 
- Having a great portfolio, outlook and good negotiation skill
- Alpha-male. Still having a hard-time convincing his ex-girlfriend that he does full-stack development
- Loves photography , bought a ton of unused cameras
- Loving debate on the Internet about trivial stuffs
- Fake that till we make it || actually never

#### The tricky Architect
- Carry a lot of certificates in his toolbelt
- Always having a team of supporters to help him in any exam
- His terminology of "cheating" is questionable
- Lack of fundamental knowledge about how computers/network works
- Being secured in a security company

#### The Network Guy
- Used to be a programmer, but decided to pivot to DevOps instead
- Having a good 'Guanxi' / Networking with people
- Loves conferences, even uses his own money/ the company money to attetnd conferences !
- Still, he still not able to configure firewalls to make his MongoDB works-on-his-machine

#### Two-way Binder

"Two-way binding used to be a godsent. Until it isn't.."

Wrote his own 'AngularJS' using JQuery since 2007, but the open-sourced community refused it because it was not 'made by Google'. Decided to use and contribute to AngularJS instead.

Enlightened by Functional Reactive Programming and Flux Pattern, he is now a core contributor to RxJS and the new Angular ( which every Indian developers hates it)

Hopefully he will get through his "two-way mindset" and becoming the 'Reakt-ive Guy' instead.

#### The Safe Zoner

"Get to the Chopper"

Having a perfect job, perfect life and family he said. Getting shit done is his motto, ensure that his team is working in a safe-zone as well. Everyone loves having him on the team, except on parties, where he rarely buys anyone a drink.

Technical Debt and Code Coverage are his enemy. At the end of the day, he wanted all his software to have 99% Coverage and 1% Debt (The Best of Both World they said), it's a learning experience for him still..

#### The Truthseeker

"I see two paths , and another in between"

Young, intelligent and enthusiast. Willing to do any work from mundane to challenging just to prove oneself in battle. His learning capabilities lead him to greatness and glory, where he was able to build something he could be proud of. It is the NDA that stopped him from showing anything to the outside world.

Having a problem of explaining things in speaking, that's why he decided that writing blogs is more preferable.

Too busy seeking the truth, he always missed the reality that there is real work needed to be done and this is not Recruiter seeks.

Luckily IdGalf found something in him, kept him to be his apprentice.

#### Idgalf

"If inconvenient, do not disturb. If convenient, do not disturb"

Master of all programming languages and tools, old and cynical, he is able to work on Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, anytime. He never attends any meeting if no agenda is defined

Unfortunately, you can only reach him through email. But, he can easily bribed with sushi OR lounas-buffet.

Having a hard time mentoring the Truthseeker to "not to give a fuck", he believes it is better for him to fall into any rabbit hole and save him later , because nobody-die-in-this movie mindset, of course.

Until then, we never know if he really gives a shit..

#### The Recruiter

"We are hiring, and we are always hiring !" 

Loves to recruit (and firing) people, also shit-posting on LinkedIn about how great the company is.

Loves "positive 'ass-backward' thinking", while hiring Indian and Russian developers to mess up with the Idgalf's source code.

Luckily IdGalf is the brilliant guy, only letting the Truthseeker to join the team and making him his most trusted person

#### The CAPtain

"Two phased-commit does not work" 

Had a great knowledge on different types of databases, he decided to make his own Lake Department, to store The Company's data in a secured, reliable databases. Somehow he is possessed with PostgreSQL, a well battle-tested database (US DOD uses it, duh!) 

Everyone called him the "CAPtain" due to his work ethic. He always get shits done at the end of the day

Unfortunately, he hates MongoDB so much, that he would never allow any MongoDB instance to run in The Company workstation, saying that PostgreSQL `jsonb` is the better approach.

Knowing him for so long ,Idgalf prefer having him decide on what database they should use in The Ivory Stack

#### The TODOist

"TODO: Refactor this, this is ugly // 20.02.2020"

- It is either Order, or Chaos would happen in the company software
- Never willing to fix things properly, putting TODOs in every line of codes
- Somehow Idgalf does not care about him. Leaving him to work with the external Front-end Guy , so they can lead themselves without spending the Company millions

#### The Artist
- Loves drawing and sketching and 'cute but deadly' design
- Emotional-first person, but enough empathy to create a thorough UI/UX 
- Customers, Marketer love how beautiful and intuitive the UI was. Unfortunately this makes every developers hate him, making the UI become the most complex state machine ever ( Ever heard of State Management ?)

#### The Co-Founder
TODO

#### The startup-founder

"I will grant you this, IF...." 

Filled with ideas and ambition, he decided that we need to make a future startup. With "ML using Python" on his desk, he can do everything. Bootstrapped a talented team, he found his idea is the 'real-deal'

Sadly, everyone ( except the Lead ) left him because of his bad leadership. With 2M euros in company evaluation, his 'product' never got released.
