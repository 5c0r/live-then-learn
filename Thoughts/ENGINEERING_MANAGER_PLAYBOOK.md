### Forewords
First of all, thank you for coming here. I know it's not easy for everyone to have me as your EM/TPM, but I guess we don't have any better choice for the time being :) 
If you are here, maybe you are /or about to be working with me, either as direct reports or not. I'm very appreciated that
And remember, you are not and will never be my subordinate. I am more or less being here to serve you and the team, and then the business, not the other way around


## FORD - Few things about me
- Family: I'm a father of one lovely daughter, Me and my wife ( and you can ) call her Lumi ( snow in Finnish ), because I hope she will always be pure as the driven snow.
- Occupation: Anything that I do right now, I would like to contribute for better good of team, company, then society.
- Study: I am currently studing Master in Medical Technologies.
- Recreation: I like LEGO since I was a kid. And recently GUNPLA. Musical-wise, rap and recently phonk and lo-fi.
- Dreams: A farm to make your own food, and an orphanage. 

## Principles:
- No personal/project-related/pet agenda - Nada I will gain, FYI
- Sympathy, then empathy
- Trust by default, verify comes later
- Your success is the team's success
- Your failure or team failure are my failure alone
- Company, team, myself last

## Meetings

My goal is to keep everyone with least meeting as possible, I'm aiming about < 6-7hrs per week, technically ~24hrs focus time for everyone

0. Bi-weekly: Purpose is for information hub, some announcement, or just a simple catch-up with everything
0. Weekly: We go through what was done last week, what is going to be done for this week
1. Dailies: Could be either async or synch, I will try to be there as much as I could. THe purpose is to make sure everyone is in the loop, and get the necessary help when needed
2. Refinement: We go through the Bugs, or upcoming refined Story/Epic
3. 1-1: Bi-weekly , weekly or montly. Much as both you and I want
4. There should be optional meeting, and I will make sure that the inviter knows what's the agenda, who is required and who's optional, so you can focus on our things
5. Pre/Post-mortem: To make sure things don't go sideways (now or later)

## 1-1
0. If you have any problem or concerns, feel free to discuss with me about it
1. If you have problem with your peers, I should be the last person to hear about it. Not because I don't want to solve it, but because most of the things could be fixed by having a conversation.
2. If you got stuck in something, I'm gladly to help you in my capacity, or find someone could
3. Your vacation days is important, everyone deserve a rest. At least some company have "flexible" day off policy, and I will make sure you know/use them
4. I usually move the calendar around, or will ask to change the cadence if I think we are having too much, so we could both focus on better things
5. If we haven't talk about performance or career development lately, you should nudge me about them, best cadence is monthly or 1.5-monthly. Your performance is important, as much as the promotion you are aiming at.
6. I do like to write appreciation post in Slack/Bi-weekly/1-1. Tell me if it's okay to write it, I do (want everyone to) appreciate your work
7. I'm happy to talk about random things, as long as it does get us to the right path/vibes
8. Your complaints about company policies, principles or individuals will always stay with me.
9. In case your ideas/complaints are 'off-track', I will adjust accordingly and try to explain things as much as possible as how I see it so we could reach an consensus, I can assure you I will never use it againts you in anyway (i.e: Performance Reviews, Upcoming Promotions, Team Transition..) - unlike my ~~previous~ bosses
10. I'd recommend skip-level meeting if you think that I am not helping you. Then a 1-1-1 for clarity.


## Working as a team
0. I might be paranoid over something and I will stay in the loop about it. If you feel that I am micro-managing, do tell me to back-off, with good rationale
1. If a meeting is held, there must be a purpose for it, what decision needs to be made , and what actions to do afterwards 
2. Meetings notes should be considered the source of truth, unless we are very on the same page, and everyone knows the context, implicit explicit
3. Be honest, truthful about whatever happened. Most of the cases, I have already know the context, I just asked for clarity
4. There's no "smartest person in the room" in my team. If this happens, perhaps we are in a wrong team.
5. When we succeed, we succeed as a team. And remember to ask me to bring everyone for a drink, or two, or N
6. When we failed, we failed as a team. We have post-mortem for that specific reason, to make sure things go better next time
7. I am happy when we succeed, and I am (sad) and accountable when we failed. Keep that in mind
8. Clarification , Communication , Conversation x3
9. When things went wrong first time, it's nobody's or my fault. But if it happens again, it's everyone fault and my fault, again.
10. If we failed to reach a consensus, then something is wrong


## Some things when interacting with me
0. I might be a bit agitated when things do not go as expected. And I am working on it
1. I might be stuttered while expressing word, most of the time due to confusion, and also the language
2. I am vulnerable by choice, so that everyone has a space to express their humility/hospitality, not for exploiting it
3. I am EM by choice, not by selection. I will try my best everyday to make sure I am worthy of the team and the work
4. English is the lingua franca of the world, but not my mother tongue. And I am also working on it
5. Whatever decisions made by me, I will make sure to keep everyone in the loop if that's everyone business
6. I don't make promises that I could not keep. And usually I will tell worst thing could happen, so we can reset our expectations a bit, but I always aim high
7. I curious about things, so I usually go around and ask everyone to get a better context. Just like going to a Tavern in RPG games :)
8. I am usually wrong about things, and I hope that I am wrong more often than being right. Please correct me if I am wrong, you have my gratitude
9. Most of the time when I hear/ask about a story, the attitude towards the story matters more than explaining the story

## PIP
Fortunately, This year I learned :) . This is the result of it, and I think it could always be better

0. I will always give a heads up about how things are going, where we will discuss whether a PIP is needed
1. We will contact more closely in a maximum 2 months period, mostly informal and the purpose is to get you back in your feet
2. After that, you will be informed whether PIP will coming
3. 2 month pre-warning, 2 months PIP , X for notice period

Why is has to be done ?
- The team needs you to perform/ behave better
- There has been 'concerns' from higher-ups/HR , and I will always take things on by myself first
- Last but not least, I am worry about you and concern about your career-life, simple as that

Why the duration ? 
- 2+ months = 2 team-sized Epics, that's the tolerate level of other team members.
- I believe 4+ months is enough to evaluate if one has get back on their feet. If not, the rest will follow

## Things I will never do, as an EM/TPM, and more importantly, as a human being
1. Un-informed/prepared PIP
2. Use people as an asset for agenda
3. Abuse your trust/loyalty
4. Sabotage the company
