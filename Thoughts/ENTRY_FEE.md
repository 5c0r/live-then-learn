The world is going to develop much further, we are going to have maybe 6 hours work day and 4 days work week ( maybe Sweden or Finland ? or any developed countries , ever ? ).

In the Corona Year 1 , I have been seeing many of my buddies switching and landing new jobs. However, those are only Mid-Level or Senior or higher positions...have we, or the whole "industry" itself ever asked:
- Where the fuck are the Entry-level positions ? Why it is so difficult to find them ?
-


## Definition of an Entry-level person , IMNSHO
- The person has basic knowledge of the field , which could be from school or hobby learning
- The person do have some small project to show your possibilities and your interest towards the work
- Can learn and adapt with/without guidance from another fellow , where later on , the person should have a acceptable level of "common sense" and autonomy ( and mastery, and purpose , pfff..)

## What is the Entry Fee

Let's imagine that you would like to join a Carnival , the only thing "valuable" thing is just a few petty coins. And you want to play more, to get the prize, so you started giving up more of your belongings.

For sanity and clarity, I will only say "what do I know" on Software/Game Development, nothing more
It would be nearly accurate to say that the "Entry Fee" is getting to be more like "Sacrificial Blood" now. So in order to be an cost-efficient entry-level developers,

### Software/ Web Development
- Knowledge of at least 2-3 JavaScript UI framework
-> What is the freaking fundamental of Web Development , and Component-based Web Development ? Why not hiring a parrot instead ?
-> What is the fundamental of programming language and OOP ?

- At least 1-2 professional ?
-> What the actual fuck ?

- Good competencies in A ,B ,C , X ,Y ,Z technologies ?
-> Why don't you just bring me the Russian roulette ?

### Game Development or just *The Game Industry*
- 3 success and 2 failed game projects, with a minimum of 10000 CCUs at Steam ?
-> Half-jokingly, are you telling me to go fuck myself ?
-> Maybe you would have better chance to make better game, then buy the company that rejects you instead xD

### For job-seekers
- Practical stuff to learn ( yes , entry fee now :) )
-- OOP, F(R)P, 2-3 sexy programming languages/paradigm, fundamentals of (Programming,Web,Cloud Service)
-> IMHO, this should keep you up with entry-level job

- Know your place, but know your worth. You can go as low as "work-for-free", but just let you know, that would not be the place you are going to stay for the next 3-6 months.
- Keep seeking, I stupid-ly believe there are good employers out there. And if you find one, considers you are in good hands
- Keep learning, the "entry fee" is definitely won't get lower, and it's okay for one to not being "ahead" of the technology trend.
- Things will eventually go full circle again, learn the "fundamentals" (ie: did we miss server-side rendering ) ?
- Focus on the onboarding and learning process
- Know what you know and don't know, do not BULLSHIT yourself
- Give in , Grow up , and Go

### Why employers do that ?
There are many reasons of why employers do that. This is going to be my explanation, not an arguments to defend the employers in many way.


- Cost-efficiency , off course. Not every company can afford to train new hires , and maybe it would be cheaper to let others train them anyway , right ?
- This is a phase where having "entry" kids would slow down a project , and ain't nobody got time for that
- Learning and training is not part of the company cult-ure. I'd consider this is a big red flag
-

### For employers
- The best way to know an entry , is to work and train them

- Technical skill should the easiest thing that "anyone" could learn or teach now. In a few more years, we could (and we will) teach any monkey to write React component / or deploy stuff to the Clouds. Entrier are expected to know things as an Entry-level , while having the learning attitude as a grown-up / senior.

- If your team consist just a bunch of "taker" , where they will not be able to "give" the "juniors what they need", your team will never grow

- We don't accept "entriers" here , you must have 10 YOE ?
-> Okay I get it , you are a big fa(s)t growing startup and you need someone can bluff you way into it. Fine by me, I hope you are happy with your bunch of dramas developer that's going to blow your cash flow

- We are constantly 'hiring', we are targeting this job ads for entry , but likely we won't hire them ?
-> Mita vittua ?

- What if we train them ,and then they leave ?
-> What if they are "shitty" , and they stays in the team and fucks you up ?
