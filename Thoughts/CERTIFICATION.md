Initial thoughts have been written down here : https://write.as/vielite1310/certifications-nein

## What is Certification ?
Certification is a method of evaluating that one person has participated in any kind of training or examination regarding a specific topic. 
- Schools/Universities use Language proficience certificates as required criteria 
- Vendor uses certificates to ensure partners has the capability to perform some kind of task (i.e: Apple Certified Fixer )

## Advantages

Certifications would give both you and your employer many advantages:

- Advantages over other candidates/contractors
- Brighter LinkedIn
- Opportunity to learn some specific stuffs that will come to be useful someday


## What are the "hot stuffs" right now ?

### Cloud Services
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- Alibaba Cloud
- Lidl Cloud ?

### Business/Project oriented 
- Agile/Lean/Scrum
- SaFE
- Azure Data/BI

### Networking ( this could be invalid at the time )
- CCNA, CCNP 

## My opinion towards certifications
Certification are basically "a piece of paper" that could prove that you are capable of doing something. Sometimes I see that not all certified "architect" or "developers" know what they are doing, as the most important thing is to understand the fundamental of how things work, and how it could be done

Example:
- If a service needs a port to be opened/forwarded , it could be that both inbound/outbound connection needs to be configured in the Firewall Configuration section (i.e: iptables, Windows Firewall..)
- A certified `$ANY_HOT_STUFF` developer which does not understand the basics of control flows / language features.


IMHO, I am againts this kind of certification model, as they are a very falsy and in-accurate way of "filtering out" candidates. Smart employers would not care about these anyway, as they should have the smarter/leaner way of hiring and it is trivial to achieve those in the first months of working.

If you are a person who is seeking for a career in Software Development, there will be others quality that I think would attract better employers anyway, hopefully I will introduce them in another post :)


## When do you need certifications ?

You should pursuit them when you are :
- Starting or passed your "junior period" 
- Your employer paid for both the learning and examination 
- You are working as a consultant/ sub-contractor
