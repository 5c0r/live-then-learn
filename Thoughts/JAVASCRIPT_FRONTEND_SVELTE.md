## SvelteJS is the new black 
- http://thecodelesscode.com/case/183


##### What differences which Svelte has over other front-end frameworks ?
- Svelte compiles your component into plain [[JAVASCRIPT]], while other framework would bring the whole runtime executed in your browser 
=> Smaller "size" , but "better"


##### I would love to learn Svelte . Why ?
- It is just [[JAVASCRIPT]]!
- IMHO, A more enhanced JSX
- Blazing fast
- Good way to build embedded UI built with [[JAVASCRIPT]]
- Hate React/Angular/people trying to say whichever is better, but would not want to learn Vue

#####  But I will not start using Svelte yet . Why ?
- Support for bundling/developing with TypeScript is a WIP . I hope it will be available in the roadmap ['soon-ish'](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4816) (i.e: HMR.. and VSCode)
- It is basically not backed (in terms of finance and contribution) by FAANG , unlike other popular UI frameworks
- Hopefully Svelte 3.x would be more stable
- SSR is there, but still a WIP 

##### Contributing to Svelte and seeing it fly ? Why not :)
