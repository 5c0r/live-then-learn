Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

## Usual reasons that could make you fail interviews in Finland

- Anxiety ( could it be from excessive coffee/tee consumption ? Or are they just genetics ?)
- Experience in X,Y,Z ( 99% are platforms and Cloud services ?! )
- Work Experience ( Usually being a "student" might be a better reasoning in 2017? )
- Not being able to display the viable/rare skills ( What are these anyway ?)
- Finnish-skills , usually apply to where most customers base are Finnish

## List of companies that I got rejected

### Finnair ( 2017 )
- Not experienced enough with Java ecosystem , perhaps a front-end developer would be more suitable , but but ???

### Reaktor
- I was rejected once in 2015 as Summer Trainee position. Then the second time in 2017 for sparring session , ended up reading [this](https://github.com/reaktor/tips-for-ppl-who-want-to-learn) instead since then 
Finally at April 2020, I got to interviews with one of the senior developers there, the discussion were long but fun and interesting. Unfortunately I am rejected due to being not very experienced with many things. 
=> Maybe this is the time to stop :D 

### Roima ( 2018 )
- The interview held quite long, I eventually got an answer back, but rejected due to recent merges. The situation is different after then :D. But all the interviewers are very nice and open about the discussion.
- Many rounds of interviews

### Circles Consulting / Siili / Houston Oyj
- Perhaps being 'too young' can be also a dis-advantage. But don't come back until you are 40/ doctor (Family Guy puns)

### Elisa 
- Never gets an answer back. Due to not being proficient in Java (or perhaps understanding how static constructor works ?)

### Sniffie 
- A small startup in Valimo, working on extension for price analysis/research
- First round went good / Second round looks better , but finally rejected as they have another candidate in mind.

Could never blame them, I was not quite good enough.
How about the other candidates ? He went to Digia anyway (July 2020?) =))))) ?

### Wolt/Foodora
- Foodora: Ghosted
- Wolt: Not good enough at React and its ecosystem, or they accidentally hired 10 or few drame queens from a "Fashion company". Hopefully the time is different, 
- But I will be working with drama queens/kings ? Nope

### Zalando ( 2018 )
- I choked while writing a switch statement => Not experienced enough, but who would like to join Zalando in 2017 anyway ?

### Futurice/Columbia Road 
- When you are not 'experienced' enough , and it is good time to give bootcamp students a chance to work :)

### Ghosted ( :ghost: deserve having its own place ! )
- Unity : Had the first interviews, never heard back
- Futurice ( ghosted once, rejected twice :(  ) => Somehow 
- Vincit
- Nitor
