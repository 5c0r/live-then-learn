## On having a Hackintosh

### Why you would like to try having an Macintosh ?

You would like to try out some MacOS feature , and see how the Apple ecosystems does work. Maybe trying out XCode and build your first Iphone App ? 

Now seems to be a good time to make your own Hackintosh, as almost-official hardware support from Apple is getting better and more diverse. I do own an AMD graphic card and and AMD Threadripper , which just works currently with Catalina 

Hackintosh makes you look cool, but not always :D

### What could go wrong with your Hackintosh
- Sometime the driver/kexts does not work very well, took time to investigate
- Some features does not work OOTB (iMessages, FaceTime..)
- Maybe for now you should opt out automatic updates
- Try to stick with not the latest MacOS releases, as latest version is not *stable* , as recent Catalina versions..
- If you needs virtualizations on your Hackintosh, Intel CPUs should be a better choice
