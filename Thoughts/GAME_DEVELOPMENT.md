# Game Development

#### Choosing a Programming Language to learn

Starting with Game Development could be a challenge, as choosing a language to learn. 

##### C/C++

Wait what, isn't nobody hiring you with this programming language ? 

Usually it is not much about the language that we learn to do something, but I believe language is a tool to achieve things, the things should be learnt is control flow and basics API. Modern/Popular game engine should have more than good documentation to get you started

Control flows, pointers and memory management is important while learning any C language family (this also holds true for C#, but at a more limited level)

Unreal Engine is the way to go if you are still interested in programming C++

##### C#

A programming language from Microsoft ecosystem. The language itself is more "open" now, and you are not limited in what environment you can develop at.



##### JavaScript
Sadly I don't have any knowledge in this

#### Game Engines that I know of 
- Unity: Finland most favorite engine ?
- Unreal 
- Lumberyard
- Godot: You can write either Go/C# 
- [Insert any JavaScript game engine here] - TODO

#### Are you sure about working as a Game Developer
In Finland , "it's going to be depends" -> BS. You will need 5 years of Game Development experience 'professionally' , or having at least 10 Games published in Epic Storee/ EA Store.

Jokes aside, I don't really know. Perhaps talking to an experience one would help a lot

#### What to go further
- Publish your own Game , in any platform
- [Game Engines!](https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74)
- Making an MMO ? Cross-platform MMO ?
