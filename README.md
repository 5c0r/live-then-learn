Hello, thanks for taking a visit to my humble repo. Hopefully you would find something useful here and there :)
This repo contains :
- 1% of intelligence
- 99% of other things, divided equally : pun, bad joke, insight, observation, seriousness, seniority, sympathy, empathy..

If you are my coworker/ex-coworker/friend, I hope that this will clarify some of the "Whys" of "Why it was done like that"

If you are recruiters,or someone who will be interviewing me in the future, someone who would interested in hiring me, up to be my future colleagues, I hope this would save both of us perhaps some time, so we could both spend our time on better things :)

I started this before I even find this #100DaysToOffload . Lucky me xD !
