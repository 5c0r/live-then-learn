## Getting to know about System Design Interview

## What you need to know , in order of importance and hotness
- Database(s) : Optimization techniques , OLAP , OLTP , indexes, query optimizer, query planner
- Load Balancing , DNS
- Some terminologies : batch processsing , offline processing , event queues , event processing, back-pressure?
- Failure / retry strategies : circuit-breaker, backoff , jitter , let it fail... ???
- Caching
- Server / instance/ computing power/ horizontal ja vertical scale
- Event/Messages queues

## Don't be like ME
- If you know the *word* , just say it , don't be roundabout like me ( because I don't really know the terminology/word , or I know but not sure if it is the right one ...)
- Try to have everything in place before moving on (i.e: UI , services, databases schema design)
- Remember on how are you going connect them , and later on splitting them
- If you are not good at visualizing everything in your head, try to learn to draw them, there should be many different tools that could help your thinking ( draw.io , excalidraw..)

## Questions you SHOULD ask / COULD DO
- What are the assumptions ? What has been put in places ?
- Functional ( what should it do ? ) and non-Functional requirements ( performance , reliability , security...)

## What I didn't know , so far


## Ref
- Design Data-Intensive Application (https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) is a very good book to read. Would recommend as most of the system design interview involves how to move and making use of the data
- Highscalability is a very good site to learn about how others big sites scalability are done
