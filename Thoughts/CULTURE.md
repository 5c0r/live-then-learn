Does culture really really matters , after all.

Somehow "my friend" got an interesting chance to discuss with a CTO about the company culture, or more about  Engineering Culture.

A little bit of the background, the company has around 80 Engineers, 10M ARR ( maybe ) . Founded since 2017, they have been facing "Engineering challenges".

First thing is Quality, second thing is likely to be an emphasis of "Playing Politics" from a subset of Engineers and Mid-Engineers / Mid-Managers. The company has issues of controlling Quality, since they have a lot of quality issues in the software delivered, both in terms of bugs, and also performance. And Oboy, they are losing customers. And they think they needed QAs, so they form a team of QA , doing Regression and all of the thing..

However, after 2 years ( now ), they decided that it is a good idea to get rid of the QAs. And focuses on Automated Testing. 

Seems like a rationale approach, someone would said, when the real quality issues has not been really addressed, if one has to said, the Engineers should think or work towards the quality. Unfortunately this was out of the question, the CTO is confident about having an Senior engineering team, but if they are Senior enough, why are they still 'there' ?
