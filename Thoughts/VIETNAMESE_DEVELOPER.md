I personally has been thinking about this things quite long ago.

Throughout my quite short career, I myself had been working with a few Vietnamese developers, and for now some Indian developers, while I think you might read enough about what people are saying about "How good/bad/mediocre/mixed-feeling Indian developers are ?" on Reddit/HackerNews/HackerRank, and you will get a "mixed-feeling" too :) .

While I guess I don't really need to say much about here, I personally believe this will come to Vietnamese devs as well, and it is just a matter of time ( when keywords like "developer" ,"full-stack", "hacker" become an instant-pu#$y-magnet...).
There are many things I believe that we (Vietnamese) could learn, and to "become something else" .

Since I am currently "living" in Finland, I will try my best to keep this writing as much positive as possible :) . Fasten your seatbelt!

Through the experience , there are many "patterns" that are happening:

- Problems are exaggerated
- Seeking validation and approval , "respect" only "managers"
- Google is truly the best friend, where searching and judgement surpassed thorough evaluation

- Sticking with "comrades" and "managers" , while patronizing others ( maybe a few more times before I can really say anything ;) )

TODO: New post. Why I enjoy having Finns , as colleagues , instead ? Why Finns are so good at making software "happens" ?
TODO2: Why not also comparing with also Finnish devs ?


There are many aspect that I would love to compare between Indian and Vietnamese in terms of history, culture and some extent of poverty (or...economy development/ ??), and how they lead to a very different IT-industry/landscape.

Pt 1: From "farmers" to "developers" . Welcome to the "Green-ish IT-industry"

Pt 3: This is better deal, believe me, we do it "cheap, very cheap" =))) - Consultancy (anywhere), in short

Pt 4: Why there's still no Vietnamese CEO, CTO, CXO in SV ?  And do they represent the "majority" ?

Pt 5: How can we (Vietnamese) become better at what we do ? And what could we "avoid" to be better ?

Pt 6: The world is 4.0 , are we 4.0-compatible ?

Pt7: We Vietnamese are just a bunch of selfish , self-entitled devs . And what we can do about it ?


But overall , are these cultural-problem or just stereotype ? What can employer do to make sure that we won't be "just like that" ?
