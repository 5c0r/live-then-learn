I have been recently decided to leave F-Secure to pursuit another oppuurtunities , and I think it could be a good "framework" for me to decide whether to leave a company. I know that just "a year" could be short, but if you look close enough , I think time would be able to tell

Hey, it's Corono time , but is it time to switch jobs ? I am not sure

While it would be quite "controversial" to say anything like this, but just keep this as your checklist.
Put weight for each one, and see if it would be a yes or no for you.

## Work
- Is the work/product interesting ?
- Does the work provide some future prospect, in terms of technical skills , reputation
- Is the nature of the work ever-changing ? Will there be fun dragons ?
- How does the politics looks like and how does it sounds to you ?
- Career progression ?
- "Startup mode" or "Corpo mode" , hierachy and such
- "Agile" or "Not Agile" , SAFE (-my ass)
- Is the Tech Stack sound good ( comfortable , nice , non-comfortable but approachable..) ?
- Were you "benched" for quite some time ?
- Good sector/ Bad Sector . If it's baaad , can you "afford" it ?
- "Mercenary" or "Missionary" (not as in the position) ?
- How long did it took for a "counter-offer" ?

## Colleagues
- Is your colleagues helping / not-helping / keeping things move forward ?
- Does the teamwork good ? What was the team composition ?
- Do you feel "valued" as a good coworker ? or as a "underlying threat" ?
- How other "process" your ideas/opinions ? Quite similar to one above ?
(i.e: Does an opinion of a "senior/manager" matters more than yours , even that they are the same ?)
- Do you feel being treated fairly , not just you , others ? And what's "Fairness" ?
- Can you come to an agreement with someone ?
(i.e: Does your "senior" comes cry to to "mama" when he/she is wrong in an argument ?)
- Is your colleagues incompetent ( in what sense ) ? Or are you ?
- Should any (in-)competence affects the performance of the team ?
- Does being straight-and-honest helps ?

Imagine of a team having to push a big Boulder ? Who would initiate the pushing ? Who would provide idea how it could be pushed ? Who would not pushing it ? Who would push it alone and silently, because it was a good sport , or "good for him/her" ? Who would make the Boulder pushed/ not pushed at all ? Who would like to push, but don't know how to push it ask for help ? Ask urself, and will be Boulder ever be pushed, at all ?


## Compensation
This is very general in Finland , so basically you got the "basic coverage" already, so really not very substantial IMHO

- You can pay the bills , having some spares for your future agenda
- Or buying a freaking TESLA Model 3 Max options and post it as a LinkedIn positive story (LMFAO)
- Insurance for you ( and perhaps your family members ?)
- Child-care ?!
- Doctors ?


## Common-Sense
- Do you like working here overall ? Just a simple Yes/No would do
- Does the work exhausting you ( both physically and mentally ) ?
- Do you have to "think-a-lot" ?
- Work-and-life balance , how does that looks for you ?
- Do you feel happy at work ?
- Can you change the workplace ? Whatever that means.
- Regarding your situation, is it a good time right now ? If it's not that good, can you "try" it ?
- Is the "new opportunity" closer to what you are looking for ?
- What is the "bullshit" you have to face everyday ? Can you deal with those ?
